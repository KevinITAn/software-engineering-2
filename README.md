💻 Software Engineering 2 Exercises - SUPSI
This repository contains various exercises, examples, and project components related to Software Engineering, developed as part of the coursework at SUPSI.

📌 About
The exercises and implementations in this repository cover different aspects of Software Engineering, focusing heavily on Design Patterns and Architecture, including:

Design Patterns: Implementation and application of various GoF (Gang of Four) patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy).

Design Principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS): Applying fundamental principles for creating maintainable and scalable software.

Software Architecture: Exploration of different architectural styles (e.g., Layered, Client-Server, MVC/MVVM).

Testing and Quality Assurance: Techniques for unit testing, integration testing, and code quality.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Deep Dive: Advanced concepts and best practices.

⚠️ Disclaimer
The code in this repository is primarily meant for learning and demonstration purposes within the academic context. While effort is made to follow best practices, the solutions prioritize clarity and understanding of the core concepts (especially Design Patterns) and may be simplified compared to production-level code.
